## **Summary:**
In this project, we developed a sophisticated perception stack for DJI Tello EDU quadcopter to enable precise navigation through multiple windows, whose 3D poses were approximately known in advance. To achieve this, we employed simulation-to-reality (sim2real) techniques to generate synthetic data, creating a robust training set for our neural network model. The chosen architecture, YOLOv8, was trained to identify and segment the front window from a complex environment of multiple windows. Once the segmentation mask was detected, we extracted the corners and applied Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm to calculate the relative pose of the front window which is essential for guiding the quadcopter through the windows safely.
