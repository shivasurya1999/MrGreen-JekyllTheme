## **Summary:**
This project focused on the generation of grasp points for various objects, utilizing the Point Cloud Library (PCL) in C++ with ROS2 integration. This endeavor was aimed at enhancing the capabilities of parallel jaw grippers in robotic applications. The objects selected for this project included everyday items such as a Coke can, a dinner plate, a door handle, and an electric drill, providing a range of shapes and sizes for testing the grasp generation algorithms.

The first step in the process involved acquiring segmented and downsampled point clouds of these objects through a camera in the Gazebo simulation environment. These point clouds served as the fundamental data source for identifying potential grasp points. The grasp points were then generated by analyzing the surface normals of the point cloud.

A key advancement in the project was the strategic manual adjustment of the camera pose in Gazebo to capture various views of the objects. This step was integral in enhancing the dimensional understanding of the objects. Subsequently, the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm was applied to merge these new point clouds with pre-existing ones, culminating in comprehensive 3D object point clouds. The use of these enriched point clouds was crucial in generating more accurate and reliable grasp points for the objects. The depth of understanding provided by the 3D models allowed for a more nuanced and robust approach to grasp point selection, ensuring that the gripper could interact with objects in a manner that was both secure and efficient. 

In addition to grasp generation, this project also focused on visualizing the outcomes. The generated point cloud and the identified grasp points were published in Rviz2. This visualization was crucial for validating the grasp points and also provided insights into the optimization of the grasping process.
