 I'm a robotics masters student at **Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI)**. During my stint at WPI I have cultivated a deep-rooted curiosity towards complex robotics problems. I attribute this passion to my work in a spectrum of projects encompassing **perception, planning, and control** across various domains such as aerial robots, mobile robots, autonomous vehicles, and manipulators. 

My experiences have not only honed my technical expertise but have also shaped my ability to dissect robotics problems from different perspectives, leading to innovative and practical solutions.

I am keen on applying my multidisciplinary skills in a dynamic team environment and contributing meaningfully to cutting-edge robotics projects. If you're looking for someone who blends analytical prowess with a creative mindset in solving complex robotic challenges, I'd be excited to explore how I can contribute to your organization.
